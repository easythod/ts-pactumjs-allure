## HOW TO RUN TESTS
There are multiple ways to run tests from this build. It all depends on what do you want to do

### CI/CD
- The tests start automatically after a new commit
- You can run the tests manually in the category [Actions](https://github.com/UgenLaps/ts-pactumjs-allure/actions)
- After each run of the CI/CD cycle, test results will be automatically uploaded to
the environment where the tests were run (GitHub)
You can check the test results at the [public access link](https://ugenlaps.github.io/ts-pactumjs-allure)

### Localhost
- Clone the project to your local computer.
- Run the command `npm install` to install all dependencies
- Execute the `npm run test` command to run the tests


After each run of a LOCAL loop, two types of log information are stored inside the repository along with test results.
- Allure HTML report in allure-results directory.

In a terminal, type `allure generate --clean` to generate Allure test results.
